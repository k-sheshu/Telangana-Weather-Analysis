# Telangana Weather Data Analysis Dashboard (2021–2024)

This project involves analyzing monthly weather data for Telangana state from 2021 to 2024. Using an interactive and storytelling dashboard, we explore rainfall patterns, temperature trends, humidity levels, and wind speed variations across regions, districts, and mandals.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of weather records with the following columns:

- **District**: Identifies the geographical region (district) where the data was recorded.
- **Mandal**: Provides detailed information about specific areas within the district.
- **Date**: Timestamp for the weather observation, enabling time-series analysis.
- **Rain (mm)**: Rainfall amount in millimeters, aiding in precipitation pattern studies.
- **Min Temp (°C)**: Minimum temperature recorded in Celsius.
- **Max Temp (°C)**: Maximum temperature recorded in Celsius.
- **Min Humidity (%)**: Minimum humidity percentage, indicating the driest conditions.
- **Max Humidity (%)**: Maximum humidity percentage, showing the most humid conditions.
- **Min Wind Speed (Kmph)**: Minimum wind speed in kilometers per hour, highlighting calm conditions.
- **Max Wind Speed (Kmph)**: Maximum wind speed in kilometers per hour, showing windy conditions.

## Project Objectives

The main goal of this project was to build an interactive and visually engaging dashboard to:

1. **Rainfall Analysis**:
   - Study precipitation patterns across districts and mandals.
   - Analyze rainfall variations over time, highlighting seasonal and annual trends.
   
2. **Temperature Analysis**:
   - Explore minimum and maximum temperature trends.
   - Compare temperature variations across districts and years.
   
3. **Humidity Analysis**:
   - Examine minimum and maximum humidity levels region-wise.
   - Identify trends in dry and humid conditions over time.

4. **Wind Speed Analysis**:
   - Assess minimum and maximum wind speed conditions by district and year.
   - Highlight extreme wind events and calm periods.

5. **Regional and District-wise Comparisons**:
   - Create comparisons across Telangana's districts and regions.
   - Visualize how weather patterns differ geographically.

## Dashboard Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - Filters for year, district, and mandal to customize data views.
  - Drill-down capabilities to explore weather data at granular levels.
  
- **Storytelling Insights**:
  - Highlighted key trends, anomalies, and significant weather events.
  - Time-series visualizations for rainfall, temperature, and humidity trends.

- **Metrics and KPIs**:
  - Summary statistics for rainfall, temperature, and humidity.
  - Regional performance metrics with actionable insights.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaned and aggregated data using Python (`Pandas`, `NumPy`).
  - Ensured data consistency across multiple CSV files.
  
- **Visualization and Dashboard Creation**:
  - Built interactive dashboards using **Power BI**.
  - Created a storytelling experience with slicers, filters, and bookmarks.

## Key Insights and Findings

- **Rainfall**:
  - Seasonal peaks and troughs in rainfall across districts.
  - Identified districts with consistently high or low rainfall.
  
- **Temperature**:
  - Clear differentiation between hot and cold months.
  - Patterns showing districts with extreme temperature conditions.
  
- **Humidity**:
  - Districts with the most humid and least humid conditions.
  - Trends showing changes in humidity over time.

- **Wind Speed**:
  - Areas experiencing high wind speeds, useful for wind energy studies.
  - Seasonal variations in wind conditions.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the power of data visualization and storytelling in analyzing weather data. The interactive dashboard provides actionable insights into Telangana's weather patterns, supporting research, policy-making, and resource allocation.
